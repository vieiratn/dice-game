# Dice-Game Challenge

My solution to the challenge posted on the **2020 Web Development Bootcamp** by **London AppBrewery**.

In order to practice some DOM manipulation this game was presented as the first bootcamp challenge on JavaScript.

This is the main goal here, to change HTML properties using the DOM.
